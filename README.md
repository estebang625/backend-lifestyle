<h1>Project Four: Lifestyle Improvement website</h1>

**<h2>Project Description:</h2>**
<hr>
This project is a lifestyle improvement website that will give guidance to people by giving workout recommendations, like yoga, cardio exercises, and weight lifting exercises, recommend books and articles that can help you continue and expand on daily activities that will help you in the future. Once people have experienced it and have experiemented on their own workouts or did further research on articles and books; they can insert their own recommendations.

**<h2>API</h2>**
<hr>
As for the API I will be planning on creating myself it will be containing images of workouts for examples, workout types (yoga, weight lifting, cardio), books and articles (snippet of article main point), links to purchase books and to article

<!-- 
Make sure you review your project proposal with your instructors so you can
make sure it's **something you can accomplish in the limited time we have**, and
make sure it's **something that'll be impressive visually**. Sometimes people do
judge a book by its cover – or an app by its design. Reach out to your instructors 
to discuss your project idea ASAP! -->


<!-- ## Requirements

### Technical Requirements

Your project must:

* **Be a complete product.** 
* **Implement thoughtful user stories**
* **Be deployed online**
* **Use something we didn't teach in class**

## Submission

Add your project info to `Capstone` tab in the [Unit Projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dz0OP4m1aaLbZcj8QiBHWuXN27hPCItsJsLINrT8Kf0/edit#gid=138749698) spreadsheet. 

***DO NOT FORK THIS REPOSITORY!*** Create a **new** repository. Then, submit
your project as an issue to this repo.

You must turn in something before presentations begin. However, you are welcome
(and encouraged) to continue working on it!

## Presentation

You will present your final project in a science fair format on the last day of
Project Week. Stay tuned for a schedule!

## Necessary Deliverables

Your submission must include **all** of the following:

### Project Idea and Initial Planning

By the end of Day 1 of Project Week, you need to submit:

1. Your project idea (a brief 2-3 sentence description of your app)
2. A list of your models and their properties

These and any other planning assets (wireframes, user stories, etc) should go
inside a `planning/` directory inside one of your project repositories. 

### Final Project

Your project is due on the last day of Project Week (the exact date is in your
course calendar). 

The repository/repositories for your final project should include:

* A working project (built by you) that meets the technical requirements above.
* Frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
* A `readme.md` file in the root of your repo that follows [good standards of
  documentation](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/documentation-markdown)
  (i.e. explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, features,
  installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.)
* A `planning/` directory in the root of your repo containing a diagram mapping
  out your project domain. You are welcome to include other planning documents
  (e.g., wireframes, user stories).
* A link to your hosted, working project in the URL section of your Github
  repo:

## Asking For Help

## GitHub Issues

You get 2 tokens to ask questions to any instructor this week. Use them strategically -- only when you really, really need help. After this week we won't always be there to help you, so keep that in mind.

## Potential Project Ideas

### Q&A App
Think of how helpful sites like Quora & StackOverflow are. Maybe there's some
other niche, or some surprising twist you can add to the question-and-answer
game.

### Car Repair Log
Keep up with your vehicle as you commute every day to your final weeks of WDI
save things like mileage, last inspect, oil changes, and maybe even receipts &
important document you need to have backed up.

### Email-like Messages
Imagine a realtime messaging client, but with private messages, an inbox, unread
messages, and who knows what else. This is your chance to re-invent email as we
know it.

Here is the GA gallery of exceptionally awesome WDI projects from all over the
world! - https://gallery.generalassemb.ly/WDI

## Tips

* **Implement one or two easy things, and one hard thing.** The hard thing
  should be what stretches you out of your comfort zone, whether it's interfacing
  with an external API, loading a map with data points, drawing a graph, or any
  other challenging thing.
* **Don’t get too caught up in too many awesome features** – simple is always
  better. Build something impressive that does one thing well.
* **Design first.** Planning with user stories & wireframes before writing code
  means you won't get distracted changing your mind – you'll know what to build,
  and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / APIs you use**.
* **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you
  can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories
  focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your
  naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your
  app and understand what everything is?
* **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting consistently? Can we find
  the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block
  or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the "what" and "why" means
  someone else can pick it up and get it.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic
  of something helps.

### Pre-employment checklist

- [ ] Add the deployed URL to repo settings
- [ ] Add a readme with:
  - [ ] An embedded screenshot of the app
  - [ ] Explanations of the **technologies** used
  - [ ] **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
  - [ ] Link to your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want
    and why?
  - [ ] Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in
    your application
  - [ ] Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had
    to overcome

## Plagiarism

Take a moment to re-familiarize yourself with the [plagiarism
policy](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DC-WDI/Administrative/blob/master/plagiarism.md),
specifically on using work you find online and on work you do with other
students.

We give assignments like this to give you the opportunity to review the material
in class in a practical manner. By building something using what you've learned
in class, you'll be reviewing the material and gaining a deeper understanding of
it.

These assignments are similar to those you can expect when applying for a job,
either in the form of a take-home coding challenge or an in-person technical
interview. So it's important that you put in your best effort now and challenge
yourself to do this assignment on your own.

If you are struggling with the material, that's alright! That's why you're here.
First, try reviewing the previous lessons and exercises. Go easy on yourself,
you're still learning! If you're still struggling after that, come to office
hours and ask an instructor for help. They're here to help you!

Don't copy and paste from another source or another student or the solution
branch. That's just going to put you at a disadvantage when you're interviewing
for a job
